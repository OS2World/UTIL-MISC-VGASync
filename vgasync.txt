 NAME
    vgasync - Keep VGA sync polarities negative

 SYNOPSIS
    detach vgasync

 DESCRIPTION
    'vgasync' runs as a background process under OS/2 and periodically
 (re)sets the horizontal and vertical sync polarities of an (S)VGA card to
 negative sync.

    Many (all?) SVGA cards change the polarities of the H and V sync
 signals to indicate to an assumed multisync monitor the current video mode
 (and implied scan frequencies). 'vgasync' allows older fixed-frequency
 monitors that require a fixed sync polarity to be used with such SVGA
 cards without requiring hardware modification of the sync signals.  With
 the addition of manual sync controls on the monitor and/or a means (eg.
 software drivers) of tweaking the VGA CRT control registers, a "fixed
 frequency" monitor can then display most of the SVGA extended video modes.

    This program requires IOPL to run.
